Campus Super Hub is a student-focused web dashboard designed to simplify everyday campus activities. 
It integrates an AI-powered email summarizer with multiple campus utilities such as mess menu viewing, 
student exchange modules, and database-backed campus service components.

The AI module summarizes long academic emails into short actionable information and categorizes them 
for easier understanding. The backend is built using FastAPI with a MySQL database layer, while the 
frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
